This repository contains code for reproducing results in the MethylVI paper.

MethylVI is a generative model of single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS-seq) data
designed to recover latent representations of cells' underlying epigenomic state while
controlling for technical sources of variation.

A reference implementation of MethylVI is available in [scvi-tools](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/latest/user_guide/models/methylvi.html).
Google Colab notebooks demonstrating its use are available in the package's accompanying [tutorials](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/latest/tutorials/notebooks/scbs/MethylVI_batch.html).
